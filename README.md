deluge-copycompleted
====================

This plugin for [Deluge][1] copies downloaded files to another location.


  [1]: http://deluge-torrent.org

Based on  original CopyCompleted: https://github.com/slai/deluge-copycompleted

Extended to use labels in directory

Extented to only copy labeled torrents. See the small change [here](https://github.com/pescobar/deluge-CopyCompleted/commit/a308d200fc6bc8b24b1095904563fe4af49bbff1)

Further updated to work for Deluge 2.0.x. In theory it should continue to work for 1.3.x, but no attempt to verify that has been made.
